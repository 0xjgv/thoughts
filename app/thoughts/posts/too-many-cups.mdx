## Too Many Cups?

I've noticed something curious about the way we use cups at home. Despite having a cabinet full of options, we tend to reach for the same few cups over and over. The ones at the front are easy to grab, while those at the back slowly accumulate dust. This phenomenon, which I've started calling the "Too Many Cups" syndrome, is more than just a quirk of kitchen organization—it's a microcosm of a broader human tendency.

This behavior is closely related to what I call the Turkey Recipe Fallacy. In both cases, we're seeing the powerful influence of convenience and familiarity on our decision-making processes. It's not just about cups or recipes; this pattern repeats itself across various domains of our lives.

In our work, for instance, we often rely on the same tools or methodologies, not because they're necessarily the best, but because they're the ones we know best. In politics, voters might support familiar candidates or policies without exploring alternatives. Even in learning, we tend to stick to subjects and resources that are easily accessible, potentially missing out on valuable knowledge that lies just beyond our immediate reach.

The real challenge, then, is for us to resist this path of least resistance. It's about making a conscious effort to explore the metaphorical "back of the cabinet"—to seek out and evaluate ideas, methods, or perspectives that aren't immediately visible or comfortable. This might mean experimenting with a new programming language, exploring unfamiliar design patterns, or engaging with emerging technologies that challenge our established practices.

By doing so, we open ourselves up to the possibility of discovering better ways of solving problems, encountering novel architectural approaches, or rediscovering valuable principles that have fallen out of fashion. The key is to recognize that our default choices, while convenient, may be limiting our potential for growth and innovation in our software engineering practices.

So the next time we reach for that familiar cup—or that go-to library or framework—let's consider it a reminder: What other options might we be overlooking in our development process, system design, or team collaboration, simply because they're not right in front of us?
