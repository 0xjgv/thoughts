## The Turkey Recipe Fallacy

A little girl asks her mom why they always cut the Thanksgiving turkey in half. The mom shrugs and says, "That's how grandma did it." Curious, the girl asks her grandma. Grandma doesn't know either and says, "It's your great-grandma's recipe." So the girl asks her great-grandma, who finally smiles and says, "I cut the turkey in half because my oven was too small to fit a whole one."

Think about the habits we follow, the routines we never question. At work, in politics, in the way we learnâ€”how often do we consider why we do things a certain way? The turkey recipe fallacy nudges us to ask: are we cutting our own turkeys in half without ever stopping to wonder why?
