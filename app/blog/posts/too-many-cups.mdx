## Too Many Cups?

Ever notice how you always use the same few cups, even though you have a cabinet full of them? The ones at the front are easy to grab, while the ones in the back gather dust. This is the "Too Many Cups" syndrome, a cousin to the Turkey Recipe Fallacy.

Just like with the turkey, we fall into patterns of convenience and familiarity. In our daily lives, at work, in politics, and in learning, we tend to use what's within easy reach. The challenge is to dig deeper, to explore the back of the cabinet, and to find out what we might be missing by sticking to the familiar. Are there better ways, newer ideas, or forgotten wisdom that we overlook simply because they arenâ€™t right in front of us?
